## Dissertation Title: Forecasting the S&P 500 Index: A Comparison of Long Short-Term NeuralNetworks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Feed-Forward Neural Networks

## Abstract: 
Industrial and academic finance, alike, have become inextricably linked to the application of ma-chine learning models and the study of financial time-series.  Consequently, the race to develop amodel that would allow the greatest advantages to be gained over the market has become increas-ingly competitive. Nevertheless, and despite being driven by the 20th and 21st Century innovationsin computer science and engineering, a truly robust and all-around model has eluded researchers.Instead, the financial literature is rife with papers examining the application of evergreen and novelmodels to specific scenarios, with little room for cross-study comparison of results, except in thecase of a handful of open-source papers available on Git-hub. In this paper, we, i), survey the sparsedevelopments in the literature on financial forecasting, ii), attempt to derive conclusions from it,and, iii) implement three of the most commonly deployed models to forecast the daily directionalmovements of the S&P 500 Index (GSPC). Namely, we apply a Random Forest (RF) with XG-Boost, a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC)with rbf-kernel, compare them according to four metrics, and judge them against a bench-markFeed Forward Neural Network (FFNN).
